Welcome!

PasswordsCon BsidesLV 2022 talk on Creating Foreign and Emoji Wordlists

Thank you for visiting our Git Repo.
Our talk on creating foreign wordlists using natural language processing tools to facilitate transliteration, as well as generating emoji wordlists based on sentences, words, intent etc. - was given at PasswordsCon 2022 at BSides Las Vegas. 

Due to the nature and details of the research, we request that you kindly email us for access to the main repository with access to our code and pre-generated wordlists in various languages with transliterated texts. 

You can also request the slides used in the presentation for further education and research purposes.

Send your request for access to research @ bitcrack.net

Sincerely,

The Bitcrack Cyber Security Team
